# Panini Complete
## This is a Forked repo
A simple stochastic simulation of the number of packs needed to complete the Panini 2014 World Cup sticker collection.

## Installation
To run the simulation yourself, download the source code and type ``python3 simulate_packs n`` where n is the number of
times you want to simulate collecting stickers.  The system will print out the number of times a collection is created,
the average number of packs needed to complete the collection, and the standard deviation of the distribution.

You can also make simulate_packs.py executable and then run that file with the number of packs.
